#  Dotnet Domain-driven design (DDD) 
 A .NET Domain-driven design (DDD) project is a software project that is designed and structured around the core concepts and processes of the business domain it is meant to serve. It aims to create a model of the business domain that is expressed in code, with each domain concept represented as an object or set of objects. The project typically includes a domain layer that encapsulates the business logic and defines the domain model, as well as an application layer that exposes this model to the user interface or other external systems. The goal of a DDD project is to create a flexible, maintainable, and scalable system that accurately represents the real-world business domain.

 In this implementation, the User entity includes an Id, UserName,Email, PasswordHash, and Salt. The Id is generated using a Guid when a new user is created, and the UserName, PasswordHash, and Salt properties are set through the constructor. Additional properties or methods can be added as needed.
